        <p class="sub-topic-p">
            To make it easy to navigate, similar objects will keep consistent structures. We will use this 
            by making Children users appear the same as each other, as well as different tasks, just with different 
            labels and possibly different colors.
        </p>
        <div class="sub-topic">Principle of Disclosure</div>
        <p class="sub-topic-p">
            We essentially want to make organizing chores as easy as possible. Therefore we will limit the input 
            that users have to provide as much as possible, and present it to them in layers to make only one decision at a time.
        </p>
        <div class="sub-topic">Principle of Multiple Classifications</div>
        <p class="sub-topic-p">
            Parents will be given two different views of the upcoming tasks, all with the push of a button. One option is presenting
            the information divided by children, each with their chores, to make it easy to check on specific children. The other view 
            being a chronological one to display the upcoming chores sequentially, in case parents care more about things getting done
            on time, rather than by whom.

            The first organization involes topics, namely the children. This will make it easy to navigate the potentially
            many chores created and see who they are assigned to.

        <div class="sub-topic">Chronological</div>
        <p class="sub-topic-p">
            The second organization involves time, namely upcoming days that have chores assigned in them. This makes it
            easy to ensure chores are being handled in a timely manner.

          1. Color and Contrast
          <p>

            Here, Apple makes use of Hick's law by greatly limiting what they present to the users visiting their site.
            They simply put two options for the user to choose from, buying the product and learning more about the product.

            2. Law of Proximity
            <p>
              Proximity helps users understand and organize information faster and more efficiently

            <blockquote>
              This example from IBM shows how they grouped elements together based on categories, to make it

              The Maaemo restaurant website shows a minimal design where it has only the essentials. If they
