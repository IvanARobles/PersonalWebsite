          Here you see a mock-up of the user page, which parents will see once they have logged in. In this example, the parent
          user has two children users in their family account and has already assigned them chores.-->
          Here you can see a mock up of the physical device we want to use. This is a camera sensor and 
          a 3D printed shell to hold it. The idea is to use this to monitor dirty dishes in the sink. We are
          undecided if we want to give parents the ability to view it live, but it's likely. In addition, it
          will take periodic images and attempt to detect change in dish levels in the sink and let parents know
          if they are not done when they should have been.

          1. Hick's Law
          <p>
            Decision-making time increases with the number/complexity of options
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            Here, Apple makes use of Hick's law by greatly limiting what they present to the users visiting their site.
            They simply put two options for the user to choose from, buying the product and learning more about the product.

            2. Law of Proximity
            <p>
              Proximity helps users understand and organize information faster and more efficiently
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              This example from IBM shows how they grouped elements together based on categories, to make it
              easy for the user to navigate the many different click-able links on the page.

            3. Tesler's Law
            <p>
              There is always a certain amount of complexity that can't be reduced
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              The Maaemo restaurant website shows a minimal design where it has only the essentials. If they
              removed any more complexity, it would deminish the quality of the page.
